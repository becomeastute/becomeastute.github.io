        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
        <div class="bottom-line">
            Patellar tendon rupture represents a rare but devastating injury affecting 0.68 per 100,000 population annually, accounting for only 5% of extensor mechanism injuries but causing significant morbidity and prolonged disability if not promptly diagnosed and treated.<sup>1,2</sup> The injury demonstrates strong demographic patterns: 80% occur in patients <40 years old, 86-90% are male, and most result from sudden eccentric overload during jumping sports (basketball, volleyball) or forced quadriceps contraction with knee flexion—though underlying chronic patellar tendinopathy serves as substrate in majority of cases.<sup>1,2,3</sup> **Complete ruptures require surgical repair** to restore extensor mechanism continuity—non-operative management is inappropriate and results in permanent functional impairment—with rupture location determining technique: 53-71% occur at inferior pole of patella (osteotendinous junction) managed with transosseous tunnel or suture anchor fixation, 19-37% midsubstance tears treated with end-to-end repair, and tibial tubercle avulsions (uncommon in adults) requiring bone fixation.<sup>2,4</sup> The 2022 systematic review comparing fixation techniques found **suture anchor repair demonstrates superior biomechanics to transosseous tunnels**: significantly less cyclic gap displacement (mean difference -1.31mm, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.56, p<0.001) with equivalent ultimate load to failure (no significant difference, p=0.29), translating to lower clinical failure rates (2.8% suture anchors vs 8.7% transosseous tunnels in systematic review of 503 patients).<sup>4,5</sup> **Augmentation significantly improves outcomes**: systematic review found primary repair with augmentation (wire cerclage, heavy suture, or synthetic ligament) reduces re-rupture risk to 3% versus 8-12% for primary repair alone, with best results using non-metallic augmentation that avoids hardware complications while providing mechanical protection during healing.<sup>5,6</sup> Return to sport outcomes demonstrate 76.7-94% RTS rate overall, but only 70.9% of professional athletes return to pre-injury performance level, with mean time 9 months to running resumption and 17 months to pre-injury sport level—significantly longer than most lower extremity injuries.<sup>7,8</sup> Professional athlete performance analysis reveals sport-specific variations: NFL players show lowest RTS (poorest outcomes among major sports), shortest post-injury careers, and largest performance decrements; NBA players demonstrate reduced games played and minutes through 3 post-operative seasons; soccer players show recovery to baseline by season 2-3 after initial performance decline.<sup>9</sup> **Early surgical repair (<21 days) is critical**—delayed repair (>4 weeks) results in inferior outcomes, increased technical difficulty, frequent need for augmentation with allograft, and poorer functional recovery with persistent extensor lag and strength deficits.<sup>6,10</sup> Rehabilitation protocols emphasize early protected range of motion (beginning 0-55° at 5-7 days, progressing to full ROM by 6 weeks) combined with delayed full weight-bearing (typically 6 weeks), with accelerated protocols showing safety and faster functional recovery compared to prolonged immobilization.<sup>11,12</sup> Partial tears (>50% tendon thickness or >20mm length) frequently require surgical débridement, with 90%+ RTS rate for both operative and non-operative management when appropriately selected, though surgical indication thresholds remain controversial.<sup>13,14</sup> Poor prognostic factors include age >40 years, BMI >25, female sex (worse outcomes than males across multiple studies), delayed repair >3 weeks, and inadequate augmentation—these predict reduced RTS rates, persistent strength deficits, and lower satisfaction scores.<sup>7,8</sup>

            <strong>Key Statistics:</strong> Incidence: 0.68 per 100,000 annually (rare injury). Demographics: 80% age <40 years, 86-90% male. Rupture location: 53-71% inferior pole patella, 19-37% midsubstance, <10% tibial tubercle. Suture anchor vs transosseous tunnel: 2.8% vs 8.7% failure rate, significantly less cyclic gap displacement with anchors (-1.31mm, p<0.001).

        <h3>Key Clinical Essentials</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Surgical Necessity for Complete Tears:</strong> Complete patellar tendon ruptures require surgical repair—non-operative management results in permanent extensor mechanism dysfunction, inability to perform straight leg raise or ambulate without assistive devices, and progressive patella alta with quadriceps atrophy. Early repair (<21 days) significantly improves outcomes versus delayed repair (>4 weeks), with latter requiring complex reconstruction, allograft augmentation, and resulting in inferior functional recovery.<sup>6,10</sup> <span class="evidence-badge evidence-strong">STRONG EVIDENCE</span></li>
            <li><strong>Suture Anchor Superiority:</strong> Suture anchor fixation demonstrates superior biomechanical properties compared to traditional transosseous tunnel technique—significantly reduced cyclic gap displacement (mean difference -1.31mm, p<0.001) with equivalent ultimate load to failure, translating to lower clinical failure rates (2.8% vs 8.7%) and eliminating complications of trans-patellar drilling (fracture risk, difficult revision).<sup>4,5</sup> <span class="evidence-badge evidence-strong">STRONG EVIDENCE</span></li>
            <li><strong>Augmentation Reduces Re-Rupture Risk:</strong> Primary repair with augmentation (heavy non-absorbable suture, wire, or synthetic ligament protecting repair) reduces re-rupture from 8-12% to 3%, with non-metallic augmentation preferred to avoid hardware complications while providing mechanical unloading during 12-week healing period—augmentation should be considered standard practice rather than optional adjunct.<sup>5,6</sup> <span class="evidence-badge evidence-strong">STRONG EVIDENCE</span></li>
            <li><strong>Return to Sport Challenges:</strong> Professional athletes achieve only 70.9% return to pre-injury performance level despite 76.7% returning to play, with prolonged timelines (mean 9 months to running, 17 months to pre-injury sport level) and sport-specific performance decrements most pronounced in NFL players (shortest post-injury careers, largest performance declines) and NBA players (reduced games/minutes through 3 seasons).<sup>8,9</sup> <span class="evidence-badge evidence-moderate">MODERATE EVIDENCE</span></li>
            <li><strong>Early Protected Mobilization Protocol:</strong> Modern rehabilitation protocols emphasizing early protected ROM (beginning 5-7 days post-op with 0-55° flexion, progressing to full ROM by 6 weeks) combined with delayed full weight-bearing (typically 6 weeks) demonstrate safety, faster functional recovery, and no increase in re-rupture rates compared to prolonged immobilization—accelerated protocols now represent standard of care.<sup>11,12</sup> <span class="evidence-badge evidence-moderate">MODERATE EVIDENCE</span></li>

        <h2>Epidemiology & Mechanism</h2>
        <p>Patellar tendon ruptures occur at 0.68 per 100,000 annually, representing only 0.6% of all tendon ruptures but carrying disproportionate morbidity.<sup>1</sup> Ruptures concentrate in younger athletic population: 80% occur in patients <40 years (versus quadriceps tendon ruptures which occur primarily >40 years), 86-90% affect males, and most occur during sporting activities requiring explosive jumping or rapid deceleration—basketball, volleyball, football, and weightlifting most commonly implicated.<sup>1,2,3</sup></p>
        <p><strong>Mechanism of injury:</strong> Acute mechanical overload from sudden eccentric quadriceps contraction during knee flexion—landing from jump with knee flexing, deceleration during cutting, or forced knee flexion under load. The patellar tendon experiences forces up to 17.5 times body weight during maximum loading, but rupture typically occurs at 3.2-6.5 times body weight when chronic tendon degeneration present.<sup>3</sup> Importantly, 60-70% of ruptures occur in tendons with pre-existing chronic tendinopathy—either recognized (symptomatic "jumper's knee") or unrecognized (asymptomatic degeneration on imaging).<sup>3,13</sup></p>
        <p><strong>Risk factors:</strong> Chronic patellar tendinopathy (strongest predictor), previous corticosteroid injections (controversial but reported association), systemic diseases (chronic renal failure, diabetes, hyperparathyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), chronic systemic steroid use, fluoroquinolone antibiotic exposure, prior knee surgery (patellar tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction), obesity, and inadequate training/conditioning in recreational athletes ("weekend warriors").<sup>1,3</sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Clinical Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Diagnosis is primarily clinical: acute onset of anterior knee pain with audible "pop," immediate inability to actively extend knee or perform straight leg raise (though passive extension maintained), palpable defect in patellar tendon 2-5cm below inferior pole (may be obscured by hemarthrosis acutely), visible or palpable patella alta (high-riding patella from loss of tendon restraint), and localized swelling/ecchymosis developing within hours.<sup>2,6</sup></p>
        <p><strong>Physical examination findings:</strong> Loss of active knee extension with intact passive extension, inability to maintain extended knee against gravity (positive extensor lag), inability to perform straight leg raise (pathognomonic), palpable tendon defect (sensitivity increases after acute swelling resolves), patella alta on palpation (sitting position allows comparison to contralateral), and relatively intact knee flexion ROM.<sup>2</sup></p>
        
        <div class="clinical-pearl">
            <strong>Clinical Pearl—Diagnostic Pitfall:</strong> Partial ruptures maintain some active extension ability, misleading clinicians into delaying diagnosis or treatment. Any athlete with anterior knee pain, "pop" sensation, and difficulty with stairs/jumping should undergo careful examination for subtle extensor lag and tendon defect—ultrasound or MRI indicated when clinical suspicion exists but examination equivocal. High index of suspicion critical as 23% of diagnoses initially missed in systematic review of combined ACL-patellar tendon injuries.<sup>15</sup>

        <h2>Surgical Management</h2>
        <p>Surgical repair is mandatory for complete ruptures, with technique determined by rupture location.<sup>2,6</sup></p>
        
        <h3>Surgical Techniques</h3>
        <p><strong>Inferior Pole (Osteotendinous Junction) Ruptures (53-71% of cases):</strong> Two primary techniques—**Suture anchor fixation** (emerging gold standard): 2-4 suture anchors placed at inferior pole patella, heavy non-absorbable sutures passed through tendon using locking Krackow or Bunnell technique, tensioned with knee in extension. Advantages: superior biomechanics (less gap formation), no trans-patellar drilling, easier revision. **Transosseous tunnel technique** (traditional): 2-3 vertical tunnels drilled through patella, sutures passed and tied over superior pole. Disadvantage: higher failure rate (8.7% vs 2.8%), risk of patellar fracture from drilling.<sup>4,5</sup></p>
        
        <p><strong>Midsubstance Ruptures (19-37%):</strong> End-to-end repair with heavy non-absorbable suture (Krackow or similar locking stitch), direct tendon-to-tendon approximation. Often requires minimal debridement of degenerative tissue at rupture site.<sup>2</sup></p>
        
        <p><strong>Augmentation (Recommended for All Repairs):</strong> Protects primary repair during healing. Options: Heavy non-absorbable suture (FiberWire, #5 Ethibond) from patella to tibial tubercle creating "safety belt," non-metallic cerclage system, or suture tape augmentation. Metallic wire augmentation effective but requires removal surgery and carries infection risk—non-metallic preferred.<sup>5,6</sup> Augmentation reduces re-rupture from 8-12% to 3% across multiple studies.<sup>5,6</sup></p>
        
        <h3>Chronic Ruptures (>4 Weeks)</h3>
        <p>Delayed presentations require reconstruction rather than primary repair: tendon ends retract/scar, gap >3cm common, need for allograft augmentation frequent. Techniques include V-Y quadriceps turndown for smaller gaps (<3cm), hamstring autograft augmentation, or Achilles tendon allograft for large defects (>5cm). Outcomes inferior to acute repair—higher complication rates (10-15%), persistent extensor lag common (5-15°), lower functional scores. Early recognition and repair within 3 weeks critical.<sup>10</sup></p>

            <strong>Clinical Pearl:</strong> Return to sport timelines vary significantly by activity demands. Jumping sports (basketball, volleyball) require longer rehabilitation (18-24 months) due to high eccentric demands on the extensor mechanism. Explosive power athletes (weightlifting, track & field sprinting/jumping) face similar extended timelines. Contact sports with deceleration (football, soccer) typically allow RTS at 12-18 months but with higher re-injury anxiety. Endurance athletes (distance running, cycling) may return earlier (9-12 months) given lower peak forces. Never clear athletes based solely on time—criterion-based testing is mandatory regardless of sport.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Professional athlete outcomes:</strong> 76.7% RTS overall, but only 70.9% return to pre-injury level. Sport-specific variations: NFL players—worst outcomes, shortest post-injury careers, largest performance declines (statistically significant, p<0.001). NBA players—reduced games played through post-op seasons 1-3, decreased minutes per game, lower player efficiency ratings. Soccer players—reduced goals/assists season 1, recovery to baseline by seasons 2-3.<sup>9</sup> Poor prognostic factors: age >40 years, BMI >25, delayed repair, inadequate augmentation.<sup>7</sup></p>

        <h2>Conservative Management of Partial Tears</h2>
        
        <p>Partial patellar tendon tears represent 10-15% of all patellar tendon injuries and require careful evaluation to determine surgical versus non-operative management. The 2024 systematic review by Sandoval et al. analyzing 454 athletes with partial tears established that >90% successfully return to sport with both operative and non-operative approaches when appropriately selected based on tear characteristics.<sup>12</sup></p>
        
        <h3>Surgical Versus Conservative Criteria</h3>
        
        <p>The clinical decision hinges on two critical measurements: tear thickness and longitudinal length. Golman et al.'s 2018 clinical series of 56 patients identified >55% tendon thickness as the predictive threshold requiring surgical intervention, with overall 20% surgical rate in their cohort.<sup>13</sup> For longitudinal extent, tears >20mm length demonstrate poor healing potential and warrant surgical consideration regardless of thickness.<sup>12</sup></p>

            <strong>Clinical Pearl:</strong> The "50% rule" provides practical guidance—tears involving <50% tendon thickness typically heal well conservatively, while >50% thickness tears in athletes warrant surgical consideration. But don't ignore longitudinal length: a 35% thickness tear that extends 30mm longitudinally behaves more like a complete tear and often requires surgery despite "acceptable" thickness percentage. Always assess both dimensions on MRI.
        </div>
        
        <h3>Conservative Rehabilitation Protocol</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Phase 1 (Weeks 0-4):</strong> Immobilization in hinged knee brace locked in 20-30° flexion to unload extensor mechanism. Progressive weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches. Isometric quad sets in brace, ankle pumps, hip exercises maintaining brace position. Pain and effusion monitoring—increasing symptoms indicate inadequate unloading.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Phase 2 (Weeks 4-8):</strong> Gradual ROM progression unlocking brace 10° weekly. Begin closed-chain strengthening (bilateral leg press 0-45°, mini-squats, step-ups). Continue crutches until normalized gait. Serial ultrasound at week 6-8 to assess healing—improving fiber continuity and reduced hypoechoic areas indicate successful conservative management.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Phase 3 (Weeks 8-16):</strong> Progress to full ROM, discontinue brace when achieving 0-120° pain-free. Advance strengthening intensity (single-leg press, split squats, moderate resistance). Begin running progression if meeting criteria: full ROM, quad strength ≥70% contralateral, no pain with daily activities. Imaging reassessment if persistent symptoms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Phase 4 (Weeks 16-24+):</strong> Sport-specific training progression, plyometric introduction (bilateral → unilateral), return to sport following same criteria as surgical repairs (strength ≥85% LSI, hop testing ≥90% LSI). Total conservative RTS timeline: 4-8 months for <50% tears, though high-demand athletes may require 8-12 months.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Failed conservative management typically declares itself by 8-12 weeks—persistent pain with activities of daily living, inability to achieve full ROM, or imaging showing no healing progression warrant surgical consultation. Don't persist with conservative treatment beyond 12 weeks if objective improvement absent. Late surgical repair of failed partial tears produces inferior outcomes to early repair of acute injuries.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Conversion to surgery indicators:</strong> Persistent pain limiting function after 8-12 weeks conservative trial, failure to progress ROM despite appropriate therapy, repeat imaging showing tear propagation rather than healing, inability to tolerate progressive loading, athlete unwilling to accept extended recovery timeline. When converting to surgery, treat as acute complete tear with same augmentation and rehabilitation considerations.</p>

        <p><strong>Combined risk factors:</strong> Patients with multiple risk factors (e.g., age >40, BMI >25, delayed presentation, chronic tendinopathy) face compounding re-rupture risk approaching 20-30%. These patients require: mandatory augmentation, extended immobilization (8 weeks vs 4-6 weeks), slower progression through rehabilitation phases, longer time to full weight-bearing, and explicit counseling about increased failure risk. Consider biological augmentation strategies (PRP, bone marrow aspirate concentrate) in highest-risk patients, though evidence for efficacy remains limited.<sup>8</sup></p>

        <h2>Evidence Summary</h2>
        <p>The 2020-2026 evidence establishes several key principles for patellar tendon rupture management. Complete ruptures require early surgical repair (<21 days optimal) with modern techniques favoring suture anchor fixation over traditional transosseous tunnels due to superior biomechanics and lower failure rates. Augmentation reduces re-rupture risk 3-fold and should be considered standard practice. Rehabilitation protocols emphasizing early protected ROM demonstrate safety and faster functional recovery. Return to sport requires extended timelines (mean 17 months to pre-injury level) with professional athletes showing sport-specific performance decrements, particularly in high-demand sports like football and basketball. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention within 3 weeks are critical—delayed repair results in markedly inferior outcomes requiring complex reconstruction.</p>
